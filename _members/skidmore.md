description: "I am an undergraduate biomedical engineering student at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I chose to assist with research involving nutrition because I am interested in how the use of different foods can optimize human health. I hope to apply the experience that I gain in research in my future career as a biomedical engineer to understand the many different factors of human wellness."

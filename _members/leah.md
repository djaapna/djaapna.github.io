description: "I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I am striving to obtain a master's degree in Nutrition and Exercise Physiology. In the future, I plan on becoming a dietitian and using my knowledge to aid patients on their path to recovery so they can achieve optimal health. Because I am so passionate about the field of nutrition, I choose to assist with research that involves dietary, as well as exercise, interventions. I enjoy utilizing the undervalued component of nutrition to help others develop a healthier lifestyle."

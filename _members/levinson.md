description: "I am an undergraduate student studying Nutrition and Exercise Physiology with an emphasis in Human Physiology and Translational Sciences. I am new to research, but looking forward to learning the work that goes into discovery. The personalized diet study is near to my heart because nutrition has been a passion of mine since I am younger. A dream of mine is to work in healthcare in the future as a physician in areas that have little access."

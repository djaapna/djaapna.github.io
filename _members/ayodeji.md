description: "I am a Postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I completed my PhD in Biochemistry from Adeleke University, Nigeria where I studied the effects of garlic on feeding behavior and oxidative stress in high fat diet-fed Drosophila melanogaster; MSc in Chemical Pathology where I assessed the antioxidant micronutrient status and hepatic functions of school children infected with Schistosoma haematobium; and bachelorâ€™s degree in Biochemistry from Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Nigeria. My current research examines the effect of almond consumption on the immune health and responsiveness of adults with obesity. This research focuses on using Immunology, hematology, and molecular biology approaches, alongside transcriptomics and microbiota profiles."

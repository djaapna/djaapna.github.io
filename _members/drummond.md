description: "I am currently a Senior studying pre-medical Health Science at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I will start medical school at Mizzou in August 2024, and I am currently interested in becoming a Family Medicine physician. I am thrilled to be involved with Dr. Dhillonâ€™s research because nutrition is such a crucial component of disease prevention and health promotion. I look forward to using the skills and knowledge I gain through this work to benefit my future patients."

description: "I am currently a PhD student in the department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Prior to being a student at MU, I earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Food Science and Human Nutrition from the University of Maine. During my master’s degree I also completed a 1200-hour dietetic internship. My graduate research at UMaine assessed the effectiveness, acceptability, and perceived value of an immersive nutrition and culinary intervention in college students, called the College Cooking Connection. My research interests include the gut microbiome, cardiometabolic outcomes, and the intersection between nutrition and mental health."

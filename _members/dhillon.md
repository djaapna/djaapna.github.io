description: "I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology at the University of Missouri-Columbia. I received my PhD in Nutrition Science with a focus in ingestive behavior from Purdue University, an MS degree in Nutrition Science with a focus in community nutrition and dietetics from Syracuse University and a BTech degree in Bioinformatics from JUIT in India. My current research examines 1) the effects of dietary and exercise interventions on cardiometabolic outcomes, gut microbiome, and multi-omics profiles, and 2) pre- and post-ingestive controls of food intake. My research also integrates large datasets generated from dietary interventions into developing computational models that can predict metabolic responses to diets."

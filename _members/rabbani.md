description: "I am PhD student in the Department of Nutrition and Exercise Physiology, University of Missouri-Columbia. In my masterâ€™s research I studied how reducing inflammation and oxidative stress by nutrition interventions can prevent cardiometabolic diseases in hypothyroid patients. During this time, I also got interested in the disruption of gut microflora in autoimmune diseases and how dietary interventions can impact the gut microbiome and improve chronic diseases. Personally, I believe everybody should find their favorite sport to live an active lifestyle. For me it is ballet, and I am going to make a difference in dancers' nutrition."
